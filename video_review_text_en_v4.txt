SmartWill is a prototype Web3 application for managing digital inheritance.

The application has two modes: for testator and for heir.
Let's start with the testator's interface.
1) To start, I will connect a Metamask wallet.
2) We create a smart will and set up regular transfers to the heir's wallet.
For testing purposes, we set the "Waiting period" to 5 minutes and the "Transfer Frequency" to 3 minutes.
The heir will be able to receive 0.0001 ETH 5 minutes after the testator's last activity.
Then, they will be able to receive this amount every 3 minutes.
In a real-world case, it would be advisable to set the "Waiting period" to 6 months and the "Transfer Frequency" to 1 month for example.

3) We update our activity by clicking the "Confirm I'm Alive" button.
From this moment, 5 minutes must pass for the heir to receive the first transfer.


Now, let's switch to the heir's interface.
1) Heir's Metamask wallet is already connected to the application.
2) We refresh the list of wills.
3) As expected, we see the will card. The funds will be available in 5 minutes. We are waiting...
4) After 5 minutes, the option to receive funds becomes available.
5) We click "Receive funds"...
6) 0.0001 ETH (Ethereum) has been transferred to our wallet.
7) The next opportunity to receive funds is in 3 minutes.

This concludes the prototype overview.
