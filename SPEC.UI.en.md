# SmartWill — a decentralized smart will on the blockchain

Hi there!  
We’re building **SmartWill** — a Web3 service that lets anyone create a smart, automated inheritance system using blockchain technology.

## The problem

Many people make regular financial commitments:  
to family members, children, loved ones, or even charities. Over time, they may accumulate significant assets.

But life is unpredictable.

If something happens to the person, their heirs might suddenly gain access to a large sum of money — with no structure or control.  
This can lead to:

- 💸 Unwise spending  
- 🧒 Loss of long-term support for dependents  
- 🧑‍🎓 Reduced motivation for older children  
- 💔 Vulnerability to outside influence  
- 🤷‍♂️ General lack of financial literacy or planning

## The solution

With **SmartWill**, anyone can set up a “smart will” directly on the blockchain.  
It works like this:

1. Configure who receives payments, how often, and how much.  
2. As long as the person logs into the system periodically, nothing changes.  
3. If there’s no activity for *N* months, the smart contract automatically triggers the inheritance schedule.

✅ No intermediaries  
✅ No paperwork  
✅ Full transparency and automation via smart contracts
