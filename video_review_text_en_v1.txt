This is an overview of a prototype web3 application for creating smart wills – SmartWill.
In this video, a smart will is a tool that makes regular payments to an heir’s wallet.

There can be several smart wills. For example:
1) The first will transfers $10,000 monthly to the wife.
2) The second will transfers $1,000 weekly to the son.
3) The fifth will transfer $50,000 to the son for university tuition annually after he reaches adulthood.
And so on.

The application has two modes:
1) The first is for the testator (the person who creates wills).
2) The second is for the heir (who can receive regular payments according to the testator’s will).

To start, I will connect a Metamask wallet.

Now you see the testator’s interface. I have already created several smart wills.

Each smart will has the following settings:
1) Heir’s full name and role (for example, son, daughter, wife, etc.)
2) Heir’s wallet – the address to which funds will be sent.
3) Transfer amount – how much the heir can receive in one transaction (Transfer: 0.0001 ETH).
4) Will balance – the total amount available for the heir (Balance: 0.005 ETH).
5) Transfer frequency – how often the heir can receive the specified amount (for example, every 3 minutes).
6) Waiting period – the period of the testator’s inactivity after which the heir can start receiving payments (for example, 5 minutes).
7) Contract address – the address of the smart contract managing this will.

All time periods are set for testing purposes; in production, these will be weeks or months, not minutes.
Also, the amounts shown are minimal and only for testing purposes.

At the bottom, there is a button for the testator to confirm their legal capacity.
Let’s click it.
We see that the "Last confirmation:" date has been updated to the current date.

Now I’ll switch to the “Create Will” tab.
I’ll fill in all the fields and create another will.
After creating the will, we are taken to the list and can see the newly created will.
That concludes the overview of the testator mode.

Let’s move on to the heir mode.
Here we see the list of the heir’s wills – the list previously created by the testator.
We can receive funds to our wallet if the testator has been inactive for the specified period.
As you can see, the "Receive funds" button is inactive because the testator has just confirmed their legal capacity.
You need to wait a few minutes.

Click “Receive funds”.
0.0001 ETH has been transferred to the wallet. Now the button is unavailable for the duration of the “Transfer frequency” period.
This means the heir will be able to receive the next transfer in 3 minutes.
In real cases, this period would typically be set to a year, a month, or a week.
