# SmartWill – The Future of Digital Inheritance

## 1. Introduction

**SmartWill** is an innovative service that enables users to create **digital wills** powered by **smart contracts**.  
Its key feature is that **inheritance is distributed in portions over time**, according to conditions defined by the testator.

Smart contracts guarantee that after the testator’s death, the funds will be **automatically distributed**  
**without third-party intervention**. This helps prevent heirs from mismanaging the funds, ensuring transparency, security, and immutability of the terms.

## 2. The Problem SmartWill Solves

### 🔹 Why Traditional Wills Are Outdated

Traditional wills come with **a number of serious challenges**, making the inheritance process **slow, costly, and unreliable**:

- 📌 **Lengthy processing** – probate and legal procedures can take **months or even years**.
- 📌 **Manipulation and fraud** – documents can be **forged or contested**.
- 📌 **High fees** – notaries, courts, and lawyers **charge significant commissions**.
- 📌 **Uncontrolled spending** – heirs often tend to **quickly and irresponsibly spend inherited assets**.

### 🔹 Real-Life Case: Blockchain-Based Inheritance for a Businessman's Family

Imagine a **successful businessman** with a **wife and five children**. He takes care of his family by providing each member with **a monthly allowance** to ensure **a stable and comfortable lifestyle**.  
The businessman carefully manages the distribution of funds, fully aware of the importance of **responsible financial management** for his family.

#### However, he has **serious concerns**:

- 💰 **All funds might go directly to his spouse**, who could **mismanage or overspend**.
- 📉 **A large lump sum might be wasted quickly**, leaving **children without long-term security**.
- 👦 **The eldest child might lose motivation** due to **access to excessive funds**.
- 🛑 **The spouse might be influenced by third parties** or **lack financial experience**, risking **mismanagement**.

### 🎯 The SmartWill Solution

With **a blockchain-based smart will**, the businessman can:

- ✅ **Configure personalized payments** for each family member **according to pre-defined conditions**.
- ✅ **Set exact payment schedules**, such as **monthly distributions**.
- ✅ **Ensure financial control** – funds are **gradually distributed**.
- ✅ **Protect against interference** – **the contract cannot be changed or canceled**.

### 📅 How It Works

Even **after the businessman's death**, **the financial distribution remains exactly as planned**:

- 📅 **Family members continue to receive payments on schedule**.
- 💡 **Heirs cannot access large sums at once**, protecting **family finances**.
- 🛡 **Gradual payouts shield the family from financial risks**.

## 4. Business Logic and System Dependencies

### 🔹 How It Works

1. The testator creates a **smart contract** specifying:
   - **Heir’s wallet address** (HEIR_ADDRESS)
   - **Transfer amount** (TRANSFER_AMOUNT)
   - **Payment frequency** (TRANSFER_FREQUENCY)
   - **Activation waiting period** (WILL_ACTIVATE_WAITING_PERIOD)
2. The contract is deployed on **Ethereum L2** (Arbitrum, Optimism, Base).
3. The testator **confirms life status** via the **"I'm Alive" button**.
4. **If inactive**, the contract **starts payments** automatically.
5. **Payments continue until the contract balance runs out**.

### 🔹 Dependencies

- **Ethereum L2** (Arbitrum, Optimism, Base)
- **Web3 libraries** (`ethers.js`, `web3.js`)
- **React + Chakra UI** (Web interface)
- **Hardhat** (Contract testing and deployment)
